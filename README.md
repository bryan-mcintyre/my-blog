# My-blog

## Description

This is a simple blog application that takes in a username, post title, and the post content on the index page on a blog form. When the form is submitted the user is directed to a blog page that renders their post from the form submission. The user then has the option to return to the main page and submit another post. The blog page updates with each submission showing all submissions.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, visit the home page, fill out the form, and submit it.

## Credits

To build this application I referenced code from this module as well as past modules. I also received help from the instructor and other students as needed.
